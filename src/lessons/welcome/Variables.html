<h2>Storing and manipulating data</h2>
  <p>The programs we wrote so far are missing a fundamental point in computing.
   Actually, it is all about processing <b>data</b> through specific 
   <b>instructions</b>. In the buggle world, the main data are a bit hidden behind 
   the graphical representation, but that's no reason to never manipulate some 
   data explicitly. 

  <h3>Data in Java</h3>
  Java allows to use several <i>types</i> of data, such as integers or strings
of chars. If you want to use a data several times, you need to store it
within a <i>variable</i>, which is a memory cell containing a value. It's not very 
different from a shelve containing a book: you put your data (say '5') in the 
variable (say 'length'), and you can retrieve it latter when you need it.

  <p>Java is said to be a <i>typed</i> language, which means that it is
only possible to store a value in a variable of the right type. Don't think
about storing the letters of your name into an integer variable.
  
  <p>To <i>declare</i> (ie, create) a variable, you just need to write its type,
a space, and the variable name. From the existing types, we can speak of
<b>int</b> (for integers), <b>double</b> for dot numbers, <b>boolean</b> for
booleans (ie, values being either true or false) and <b>String</b> for char
strings. If you want, you can specify the initial value of the variable by
adding a equal sign (=) followed by the value after the declaration. </p>
  <p>So, to create a variable named <b>x</b> intended to contain integers, one
can write: <pre>int x;</pre>
	 If you want that the variable contains 5 as initial value, you should type: <pre>int x = 5;</pre>
  <p>Later in the program, if you want to <i>affect</i> a new value to the
variable, that's really easy: <pre>x = 3;</pre>
      
<p>The syntax to create an integer variable <code>x</code> with 4 as initial
value is the following: 
<pre>int x = 4;</pre>
<p>This quite the same story for strings, floating point numbers and boolean values. 
<pre>String name = "Martin Quinson";
double height=1.77; <span class="comment">// in meters</span>
boolean married=true;</pre>


<p>To the right of the equal symbol, you can put an expression containing constants, 
variables and operations: 

<pre>x = 3 + 2;
x = 3 * x;
greeting = "Hello "+name;
</pre> 


<h3>Exercise goal</h3>
It is now time to do more challenging exercises, don't you think? 
The objective is now to move forward until you find a baggle,
pick it up, and then move back to your initial location before dropping the
baggle.

<h3>How to do this?</h3> 
<p>To solve this problem, you have to decompose it in easier sub-parts. For
example, you may want to do the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Move forward until located over a baggle</li>
  <li>Pickup the baggle</li>
  <li>Move backward of the same amount of steps than done in first step</li>
  <li>Drop back the baggle</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Naturally, it is impossible to do the right amount of steps backward at step
3 if you didn't count the amount of steps done in the first phase. You can
use a variable for that, which can be named <code>stepAmount</code>.</p>

<p>Create a variable (of type <code>int</code>) before phase 1, initialize it
to 0, and each time you move one step forward, increment its value by one
(<code>stepAmount = stepAmount + 1;</code> or <code>stepAmount++;</code>,
both syntaxes being equivalent).</p>

<p>Then, phase 3 consists in simply creating a new integer variable
<code>doneSteps</code> initialized to 0, and do one step backward until
<code>doneSteps</code> equals <code>stepAmount</code>, incrementing
<code>doneSteps</code> each time.</p>

<p>Please note that it is forbidden to use spaces in variable names in Java. So
you can name you variable <code>stepAmount</code>, but <code>step
Amount</code> is not a valid name.</p>

<p>It's your turn now!</p>
